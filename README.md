# Customer-Support-Agent
 AI-Powered Multilingual Customer Support Agent with Voice &amp; Text Integration This enterprise-grade customer support solution leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence to deliver seamless, multilingual customer interactions through both voice and text channels. 
Core Architecture & Technology Stack:

The backend infrastructure utilizes FastAPI, a high-performance Python web framework, ensuring asynchronous request handling and optimal scalability. MongoDB serves as the persistent data layer, storing comprehensive conversation histories and user profiles with Motor's async driver for non-blocking database operations. The system integrates Google Gemini Pro for advanced natural language understanding and context-aware response generation, while ElevenLabs provides bidirectional speech processing—converting user voice queries to text (STT) and AI responses back to natural-sounding audio (TTS).

Key Features & Capabilities:

The platform supports dual-mode communication: users can type messages or speak naturally, receiving instant AI-generated responses in both text and audio formats. The system maintains contextual awareness by analyzing conversation history, enabling coherent multi-turn dialogues. All interactions are automatically logged with timestamps, user identification, and audio recordings for quality assurance and analytics.

The frontend, built with Next.js and TailwindCSS, delivers a responsive, mobile-optimized interface with real-time Web Audio API integration for seamless voice recording. The RESTful API architecture exposes endpoints for chat, voice processing, conversation retrieval, and health monitoring, making integration straightforward for existing business systems.

Production-Ready Infrastructure:

Docker containerization ensures consistent deployment across environments, with docker-compose orchestrating the complete stack—backend API, frontend application, and MongoDB database. Environment-based configuration management secures sensitive API credentials while enabling easy scaling. The system includes comprehensive error handling, CORS middleware for cross-origin requests, and audio file management with streaming capabilities.

Scalability & Future Enhancements:

The modular design supports future CRM integrations (HubSpot), cloud storage migration (AWS S3), and analytics dashboards. The bilingual support (Hindi/English) demonstrates internationalization readiness, with architecture supporting additional language expansion. This solution is ideal for businesses seeking to automate customer support while maintaining personalized, empathetic interactions at scale.
